# Base EFM32 CMake file
#
# This can be used as is as a project base, or by adding the efm32-base
# repository as a submodule to another project, copying this CMakeLists file
# to the top level directory, and updating the BASE_LOCATION variable to reflect this
# change

###### Project Environment #####

# Set minimum CMake version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.4)

# Set efm32-base project location
set(BASE_LOCATION .)

# Set the compiler (must be prior to project setup)
include(${BASE_LOCATION}/toolchain/arm-gcc.cmake)

##### Project Setup #####

# Set our output target
set(TARGET stm32-test)

# Configure project and languages
project(${TARGET} C CXX ASM)

# Set device
if(NOT DEVICE)
set(DEVICE STM32F429zit6)
endif()

# Set BSP (Evaluation kits only)
set(BSP "STM32F429I-Discovery")
set(BSP_COMPONENTS "ili9341;stmpe811")

# Set build
if(NOT CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE DEBUG)
endif()

##### Modules #####

# Libraries can be added to the LIBS variable
# or manually included here.

# Add base libs (emlib, CMSIS, device files)
include(${BASE_LOCATION}/toolchain/stm32-base.cmake)

##### Files #####

# Add project files
include(${BASE_LOCATION}/example/example.cmake)

##### Outputs #####

# Generate executable and link
add_executable(${TARGET} ${PROJECT_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(${TARGET} ${LIBS})

##### Post build #####

# Add post build commands
include(${BASE_LOCATION}/toolchain/post-build.cmake)

# Add JLink commands
include(${BASE_LOCATION}/toolchain/jlink.cmake)
